# hello-world

Hello there!

This is my first repository in GitHub (after a long time). I tried to use GitHub 2 years ago but I didn't find it useful. I do few short codes in MATLAB to analyze experimental data.
Lately, I got interested in coding for simple but interesting physics problems. Good luck to me!
